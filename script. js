Options error: DEPRECATION: No tls-client or tls-server option in configuration detected. OpenVPN 2.8 will remove the functionality to run a VPN without TLS. See the examples section in the manual page for examples of a similar quick setup with peer-fingerprint. OpenVPN 2.7 allows using this configuration when using --allow-deprecated-insecure-static-crypto but you should move to a proper configuration using TLS as soon as possible.
Use --help for more information.
